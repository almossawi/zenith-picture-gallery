Using IPTC data in batch adds

The idea behind this is that if you want to batch add pictures, then you might prefer 
to use the values you have in your IPTC fields for each of the pictures instead of the defaults
that the gallery sets in Admin CP -> Batch Add.  The way it works is that you modify the file 
functions/f_admin.php for each field whose value you want to set to an IPTC field and the script 
does the rest.

Full instructions are in the file lib/jpeg_metadata_toolkit/INSTRUCTIONS.php

The code used to do all this cool stuff is from the JPEG Metadata Toolkit API.
